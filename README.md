## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
Sweater Weather Express is simple lightweight API that uses the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev/docs) and the [Google Geocode API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/start) to return forecast data for specific cities or for cities in a user's favorites. Users can send POST or DELETE requests to manage their favorites. To get started right away with the production API, view the [API documentation](#api_docs). Or if you want to tinker with the code, follow the setup steps below.

## Initial Setup <a name="setup"></a>
1) To get started using this app, you'll first need to clone it and install dependencies.
```
git clone git@github.com:fentontaylor/sweater-express.git
npm install
```
2) Next, you'll need to set up the database
```
psql
CREATE DATABASE sweater_express_dev;
CREATE DATABASE sweater_express_test;
\q

knex migrate:latest
knex migrate:latest --env test
knex seed:run
```
3) Finally to start the server using:
```
npm start
```
4) Use your favorite client, like Postman, or send curl requests to the base url:
```
http://localhost:3000/
```

## How to Run Tests <a name="tests"></a>
Run tests with the command:
```
npm test
```

## API Documentation <a name="api_docs"></a>

### All Requests
#### Base url:
```
https://sweater-express.herokuapp.com
```
#### Endpoints:
- [GET /api/v1/forecast?location={location}](#get_forecast)
- [GET /api/v1/favorites](#get_favorites)
- [POST /api/v1/favorites](#post_favorites)
- [DELETE /api/v1/favorites](#delete_favorites)

- Every request must include the API key in the JSON body of the request with the key "api_key". You can use the key `jgn983hy48thw9begh98h4539h4` to test the API.

**Example**
```
body:
{
  "api_key": "jgn983hy48thw9begh98h4539h4"
}
```
- If no API key or an incorrect key is provided, the server will respond with status 401 (Unauthorized) and an error message.

```
Content-Type: application/json

### Add Favorites Request <a name="post_favorites"></a>
```
POST /api/v1/favorites

**Success Response:**
```
status: 200
body:

{
  "message": "Denver, CO has been added to your favorites",
}
```
**Error Response:**
```
status: 409
body:

{
  "message": "Denver, CO is already in your favorites",
}
```

### Delete Favorites Request <a name="delete_favorites"></a>
```
DELETE /api/v1/favorites
```
- Successful deletion responds with status 204.
- If the location specified is not found in the favorites, response status is 404.

```
- Returns current weather summary for all of a user's favorite locations.
- Responds with status 422 if location is missing in JSON request.
